Church-Rosser checking of READERS-WRITERS-PREDS
Checking solution:
  All critical pairs have been joined. The specification is
    locally-confluent.
  The specification is sort-decreasing.
)

rewrites: 4958 in 0ms cpu (6ms real) (~ rewrites/second)

Coherence checking of READERS-WRITERS-PREDS
Coherence checking solution:
  All critical pairs have been rewritten and all equations
    are non-constructor.
  The specification is coherent.
