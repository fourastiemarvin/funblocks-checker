Church-Rosser checking of READERS-WRITERS-ABS
Checking solution:
  All critical pairs have been joined. The specification is
    locally-confluent.
  The specification is sort-decreasing.

Coherence checking of READERS-WRITERS-ABS
Coherence checking solution:
  The following critical pairs cannot be rewritten:
  cp < s(0),0 >
    => < s(N*@:Nat),0 > .
