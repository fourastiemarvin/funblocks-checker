Termination of R to be shown.





   R     ->Removing Redundant Rules



Removing the following rules from R which fullfill a polynomial ordering: 

   add-`[Nat`]-`[Nat`]($x, add-`[Nat`]-`[Nat`]($y, zero)) -> $x

where the Polynomial interpretation:
POL(add-`[Nat`]-`[Nat`](x_1, x_2)) = 1 + x_1 + x_2
POL(succ-`[Nat`](x_1)) = x_1
POL(empty) = 0
POL(depth-`[Treeocb-$T-ccb`](x_1)) = x_1
POL(zero) = 0
was used. 



Not all Rules of R can be deleted, so we still have to regard a part of R.

This program has no overlaps, so it is sufficient to show innermost termination.

R contains no Dependency Pairs  and therefore no SCCs.
