---------------------------------------------------------
Detailed comments (stylistic, typos, etc)
--------------------------------

abstract: 
--------

[DONE] I would remove "One of the most exciting ... that"

intro: 
-----

[DONE] skip the two sentences "One of the key aspects to designing .... 
future developments?"

[DONE] what is the "model-view-controller pattern"? maybe a couple of 
words or a reference explaining this notion would not hurt?

[TODO] tool URL: the web page asks us to download Maude 2.6++. It seems 
that you mean 2.5++?

Section 2: 
---------

[DONE] I would probably start with some gentle introduction like
    "We assume that the reader is familiar with the basics of rewriting
     logic and Maude, and refer to ... for an introduction to these."
     or something.

[SKIP]  BUT, if you anyways assume knoweldge of Maude, I would probably
  skip/shorten all this explanation of 'object-based programming', 
  including the 
  sort Configuration and object-oriented rules, since this would also
  be familiar to any intended reader of the paper. 
  
I think we can assume certain familiarity with equational specifications and 
some intuition on rewriting. How to do object-oriented programming is not 
simple, and with some of the descriptions given one could hardly follow the rest.  

[DONE] "are pairs attribute name-current value" should probably be rephrased

[DONE] next page,  "Since class names  ... subsort declaration C < C'" can 
safely be removed

Section 3.1:
----------

[TODO] I am a little bit confused: the proof objects seem not to have actual
  "proofs" ... then you write "The ... proof object representing the 
  state of the proof."
  Where is this? Is the point that a module only has one thing to do?
  That's not the case for the ITP at least. Anyways, this is confusing 
  and should be clarified.

[DONE] "a class inheriting from Proof": probably better to write just "a 
   subclass of Proof" (even if subclass by transitivity)

Section 3.3:
----------

[DONE?] Many places (e.g., "done by attribute tools") you should add 'the': 
  "done by the attribute tools"
  
I'm not sure. I'd say "the tools attribute", but I think both "attribute tools"
and "the attribute tools" are correct. Probably the reviewer is right ;-)

[DONE] next page, below middle: "The getName and qid2tool operators returns": 
  should be "return"

Section 3.4, second page:
-------------------

[DONE] "User inputs are first ... active tool." This is a very useful feature, 
  but it has been said TOO many times by now. 

[DONE] "It broadcasts two messages ...": do you really mean "broadcast"? 
  Every message has one receiver, so maybe "sends" or "unicasts" is 
  more appropriate?

[DONE] "it forwards to itself a version ...": in the code snippet, it seems 
  like the message is sent from O'. Maybe you want (to O from O : getTerm...) 
  in the rule?

Section 4
---------

[TODO] It's not a big deal, and it has been given in the introduction, 
  but I would still add a reference to each tool again when discussed here. 

[DONE] "non trivial" should be one word

[DONE] "please check the given references" should be something like "we refer to ..."  or something kinder

[DONE] 4.1: It's strange that the second paragraph motivates the tool.
  Probably you want to switch the order of the two paragraphs in this section.

Section 4.4:
---------

[SKIP] "tree-automaton-based" is better

Sounds good, isn't it? What would you write "tree-automaton based" or "tree-automata-based"?

I'd go for "tree-automata-based"

[DONE] maybe in this section, you should say something about constructors?

Perhaps he is right. Given some intuitition from a Maude programmer/specifier point of view wouldn't hurt.

[DONE] "non-deterministic" usually come without a hyphen

[DONE] "equationally defined in all inputs": maybe "for all arguments" is better

Either of them. You pick.

Section 5:
--------

[DONE] line 2: "take  ... advantage ... from the infrastructure" should be 
  "take .. advantage ... of ..."

Section 5.1:
-----------

[DONE] line 1: "of class SCCProof, WHICH IS a subclass of Proof"

[DONE] the sort 3Bool shows up different places. What is this?

[DONE] next page, "offered in MFE" should probably "offered by".  
  Furthermore, this sentence "Thanks to ... tools." is actually 
  not a well formed sentence. Please rephrase.

Section 5.2:
---------

[DONE] "instance of class SCCTool, WHICH IS a subclass of MFE's Tool.
   THE class SCCTool inherits from Tool its attributes and behavior": 
   The second sentence is obviously not needed, as this has been 
   stated before (and is very well known)

[DONE] next page, I would add "the" in front of "command X" many places 
  in this section. 

Section 6, next page:
----------------

[SKIP] the inclusion of module MBool here is confusing as it is not used here,
   but only in the abstraction. Move it there. 
   
I don't think it's confusing there, but we can move it right before module READERS-WRITERS-PREDS
(ooops, without the "the")

[DONE] "we must check ... the equations being ground terminating and CR": well,
   since you don't have ANY equations, this does not really have to be 
   checked :-)
   (Same thing with "there are no critical pairs between equations")
   
Perhaps we can say something like the module is trivially terminating and Church-Rosser. 
But the actual check must be left.

[DONE] next page, line -3: remove "trivially"

[DONE] next page:
    "at most one reader or one reader [sic]": you obviously do not mean this

References:
----------

[DONE] 13 and 14 have appeared

[DONE] 15: capitalize Church and Rosser; furthermore, the paper is 
   at the moment NOT accepted for publication!
   
He is actually right. The paper "is accepted under the condition of a properly 
executed minor revision". The deadline for submitting the final version was April 1st, 
but we didn't do it yet. 

Maybe we should say "Submitted for publication".

[DONE] 16: do you have a journal number?

[DONE] 21 and 22 refer to the same thesis!

[DONE] 26: shoud 'hets' be capitalized?
