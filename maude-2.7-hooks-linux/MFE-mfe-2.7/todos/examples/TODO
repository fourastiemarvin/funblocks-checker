An specification here consists of at least two modules, namely XXX and XXX-PROPS
defining the behavior of a concurrent system and a set of state predicates,
respectively. Module XXX is a system module and module XXX-PROPS is a functional
module.

For each XXX one needs to check:

- Ground confluence, ground sort-decreasingness, and ground coherence, 
  strong EQUATIONAL termination, sufficient completeness, and freeness of constructors.

For each XXX-PROPS one needs to check:

 - Ground confluence and ground sort-decreasingness, and strong EQUATIONAL termination .

An specification here consists of exactly a system module XXX.

For each XXX one needs to check:

- Ground confluence, ground sort-decreasingness, and ground coherence, 
  weak EQUATIONAL and REWRITE termination
