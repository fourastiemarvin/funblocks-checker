--- Consider the following proof script:
(set include BOOL off .)
load bakery.maude
(select tool CRC .)
(ccr BAKERY-PROPS .)   
(submit .)

--- The proof obligation when submitted to the ITP generates a bounch of errors
--- that I do not understand properly. It seems there is a problem with sort Nat;
--- maybe the solution is to rename sort Nat to sort Nat2, or so.
