There is a bug with the way the MFE looks for the file 

  tools-batch-files.txt

because depending on where a proof script is located, the environment
may or may not find this file.

A possible solution is to have a global variable that can be used to
determine where to look for the file (similar to the use of MAUDE_LIB for Maude).
