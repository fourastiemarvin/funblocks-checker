---- PD: One can always trust the proof in the meanwhile ;-)

--- Consider the following proof script:

(set include BOOL off .) 
load qlock.maude 
(select tool MTT .) 
(ctf QLOCK .) 
(trust .)                     ---- PD
(select tool CRC .) 
(ccr QLOCK .) 
(submit .) 

--- Because of qlock.todo1 , QLOCK cannot be proved to be Chruch-Rosser
--- -or ground coherent-.
