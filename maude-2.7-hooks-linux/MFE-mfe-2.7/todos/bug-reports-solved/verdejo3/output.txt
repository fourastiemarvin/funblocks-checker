rewrites: 80 in 10ms cpu (11ms real) (7976 rewrites/second)
The MTT has been set as current tool.

rewrites: 39 in 7ms cpu (9ms real) (5136 rewrites/second)
aprove is now the current external tool.

rewrites: 45567 in 157ms cpu (18237ms real) (290025 rewrites/second)
Success: The module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION is terminating.

rewrites: 43 in 16ms cpu (19ms real) (2591 rewrites/second)
Success: The module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION is terminating.

rewrites: 76 in 0ms cpu (2ms real) (77079 rewrites/second)
The CRC has been set as current tool.

Church-Rosser check for UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION
    All critical pairs have been joined.
    The specification is locally-confluent.
    The module is sort-decreasing.

rewrites: 91 in 14ms cpu (17ms real) (6462 rewrites/second)
The termination goal for the functional part of UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION
    has been submitted to MTT.
The functional part of module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION has been checked
    terminating.
Success: The module is therefore Church-Rosser.
Success: The module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION is Church-Rosser.

rewrites: 76 in 1ms cpu (2ms real) (38190 rewrites/second)
The SCC has been set as current tool.

rewrites: 3643 in 9ms cpu (14ms real) (384891 rewrites/second)
Warning: The sufficient completeness checker is not fully available. Please use
    the trust command to assume that module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION is
    sufficiently complete.

rewrites: 38 in 0ms cpu (2ms real) (~ rewrites/second)
Module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION is trusted to be sufficiently complete.

rewrites: 76 in 0ms cpu (2ms real) (~ rewrites/second)
The ChC has been set as current tool.

rewrites: 659811 in 966ms cpu (993ms real) (682691 rewrites/second)
Coherence checking of UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION
    The following critical pairs cannot be rewritten:
  cp UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION17 for A1 and rec
    {L:List,M:Natural | #3:Conf[N:Natural,J:Natural]| P:List,J:Natural}
    =>{L:List,M:Natural | #3:Conf ack(J:Natural)[N:Natural,J:Natural]| P:List @
    N:Natural ; nil,s(J:Natural)}.
    The sufficient-completeness, termination and Church-Rosser properties
    must still be checked.

rewrites: 2315 in 28ms cpu (28ms real) (81085 rewrites/second)
The Church-Rosser goal for UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION has been submitted to
    CRC.
The Sufficient-Completeness goal for UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION has been
    submitted to SCC.
The goal for critical pair UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION17 has been submitted
    to ITP.
The termination goal for the functional part of UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION
    has been submitted to MTT.
Sufficient completeness check for UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION trusted!
Church-Rosser check for UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION
    All critical pairs have been joined.
    The specification is locally-confluent.
    The specification is terminating, and therefore confluent.
    The module is sort-decreasing.
    Success: The module is therefore Church-Rosser.
The functional part of module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION has been checked
    terminating.
The module UNORDERED-CHANNEL-ABSTRACTION has been checked Church-Rosser.
